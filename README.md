# Boas_Compras_App
Attempt to create a app that's show the lowest supermarket prices. Its use Java as main language and PHP+MYSQL in the server that's return data using JSON.

Why did I give up? 

The idea was good, but I realised to keep the whole system up running include the staff to get the prices and keep everything update is expensive even if I try to do everything + 
the supermaket owners would not invest on it because they already have the market forces. So, fuck this project.
